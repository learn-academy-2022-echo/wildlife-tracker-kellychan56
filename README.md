# Wildlife Tracker Challenge

The Forest Service is considering a proposal to place in conservancy a forest of virgin Douglas fir just outside of Portland, Oregon. Before they give the go ahead, they need to do an environmental impact study. They've asked you to build an API the rangers can use to report wildlife sightings.

**Story 1: In order to track wildlife sightings, as a user of the API, I need to manage animals.**

**Branch:** animal-crud-actions

**Acceptance Criteria**

✅ - Create a resource for animal with the following information: common name and scientific binomial
    $ `rails g resource Animal common_name: string scientific_binomial: string`
        Prefix  Verb    URI Pattern Controller         #Action
        animals
                GET     /animals(.:format)             animals#index
                POST    /animals(.:format)             animals#create
        new_animal
                GET     /animals/new(.:format)         animals#new
        edit_animal
                GET     /animals/:id/edit(.:format)    animals#edit
        animal
                GET     /animals/:id(.:format)         animals#show
                PATCH   /animals/:id(.:format)         animals#update
                PUT     /animals/:id(.:format)         animals#update
                DELETE  /animals/:id(.:format)         animals#destroy
    $ `rails db:migrate`
    - disable authenticity token
        `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`

✅ - Can see the data response of all the animals
    - create one instance of an animal in rails console to see it in the db
        >> Animal.create(common_name:'Dratini', scientific_binomial:'aquatilis draconis')
    - make an index method to render the animal database

✅ - Can create a new animal in the database
    - make a create method to add individual animals
    - add strong params to controller for animal

✅ - Can update an existing animal in the database
    - make an update method

✅ - Can remove an animal entry in the database
    - make a destroy method

**Story 2: In order to track wildlife sightings, as a user of the API, I need to manage animal sightings.**

**Branch:** sighting-crud-actions

**Acceptance Criteria**

✅ - Create a resource for animal sightings with the following information: latitude, longitude, date
    - Hint: An animal has_many sightings (rails g resource Sighting animal_id:integer ...)
    - Hint: Date is written in Active Record as `yyyy-mm-dd` (“2022-07-28")
    $ `rails g resource Sightings animal_id:integer latitude:string longitude:date date:date`
        Prefix  Verb    URI Pattern Controller         #Action
        sightings
                GET     /sightings(.:format)             sightings#index
                POST    /sightings(.:format)             sightings#create
        new_sighting
                GET     /sightings/new(.:format)         sightings#new
        edit_sighting
                GET     /sightings/:id/edit(.:format)    sightings#edit
        sighting
                GET     /sightings/:id(.:format)         sightings#show
                PATCH   /sightings/:id(.:format)         sightings#update
                PUT     /sightings/:id(.:format)         sightings#update
                DELETE  /sightings/:id(.:format)         sightings#destroy
    - made an association between animal and sighting in models

✅ - Can create a new animal sighting in the database
✅ - Can update an existing animal sighting in the database
✅ - Can remove an animal sighting in the database

**Story 3: In order to see the wildlife sightings, as a user of the API, I need to run reports on animal sightings.**

**Branch:** animal-sightings-reports

**Acceptance Criteria**

✅ - Can see one animal with all its associated sightings
✅ - Hint: Checkout [this example](https://github.com/learn-co-students/js-rails-as-api-rendering-related-object-data-in-json-v-000#using-include) on how to include associated records
  - on the show method for the animals controller, use "include" to render the animal sightings along with the animal
✅ - Can see all the all sightings during a given time period
  - Hint: Your controller can use a range to look like this:

```ruby
class SightingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    sightings = Sighting.where(date: params[:start_date]..params[:end_date])
    render json: sightings
  end
end
```

✅ - Hint: Be sure to add the start_date and end_date to what is permitted in your strong parameters method
✅ - Hint: Utilize the params section in Postman to ease the developer experience
  - params section in Postman has key and value columns
    - in the key column, enter start_date and end_date
    - in the value column, enter the desired dates for the range
✅ - Hint: [Routes with params](./controllers-routes-views.md)

## Stretch Challenges

**Story 4: In order to see the wildlife sightings contain valid data, as a user of the API, I need to include proper specs.**

**Branch:** animal-sightings-specs

**Acceptance Criteria**
Validations will require specs in `spec/models` and the controller methods will require specs in `spec/requests`.

- Can see validation errors if an animal doesn't include a common name and scientific binomial
- Can see validation errors if a sighting doesn't include latitude, longitude, or a date
- Can see a validation error if an animal's common name exactly matches the scientific binomial
- Can see a validation error if the animal's common name and scientific binomial are not unique
- Can see a status code of 422 when a post request can not be completed because of validation errors
  - Hint: [Handling Errors in an API Application the Rails Way](https://blog.rebased.pl/2016/11/07/api-error-handling.html)

**Story 5: In order to increase efficiency, as a user of the API, I need to add an animal and a sighting at the same time.**

**Branch:** submit-animal-with-sightings

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Can create new animal along with sighting data in a single API request
  - Hint: Look into `accepts_nested_attributes_for`
